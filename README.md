### Abstract

Fraudulent bank accounts are a problem for many banks since they lose money from needing to manually detect and remove the fraudulent accounts before they apply for fraudulent loans or allow for government regulation to intervene with penalties. In this paper we propose using supervised machine learning for automatic detection of fraudulent bank fraud applications and achieve an AUCROC score of 0.9878 using an XGBoost model and the recall at 5% FPR was 94% fine-tuned using Optuna AutoML. We present the exploratory data analysis and preprocessing required to achieve such results, leading to the development of a web user interface for testing new observations.
